Because there is a lot of positioning to get your hot spots set up 
and active do these steps before you start in on the coordinates.
Some recommendations:

- I strongly recommend using soft coding so that if you do need to change the
over all size of your canvas or the diameter of your hotspots, it's easier to make adjustements. 

- use a grid to help you work out the coordinates of your hot spots(and then comment out when no longer needed)

- use the fullScreen(); function instead of the size(); 
function to give your work a cleaner look and more immersive experience

To begin, first determine:
- size of canvas (this means having your image(s) all set to go)
- diameter of hotspots (how large an area do you want to be the trigger for the audio)?
- will hot spot be visible? How will you indicate the user is over a hot spot:
    - cursor change?
    - hot spot changes colour?
- how do you want to deal with the audio? Connor has provided you with three options:
    - If you want the audio to only stay on while you hover over the trigger area 
    (this is the fully coded option - you'll have to expand the code for the other two should you choose those options)
    - If you wish to have the audio stay on till another spot is triggered
    - If you want the audio to stay on till completion and then reset once you move off the trigger area
    

Collecting media:
- format image(s) to required size
- test all audio clips (sometimes found sound files don't work)
- determine the length of your audio clips (they should be long enough that they don't need to loop, so 
considered the immersive experience you're trying to create: find the sweet spot in terms of how long
your listener needs to spend on each hotspot to get a good sense of what's going on there with the audio
